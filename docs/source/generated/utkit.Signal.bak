utkit.Signal
============

.. currentmodule:: utkit

Represents physical signals, by keeping track of the index (time/space) and corresponding
values. This class extends the Pandas :class:`pandas.Series` class to make it more
convenient to handle signals generally encountered in ultrasonics.

The class constructor is the same as that used for :class:`pandas.Series`, with an extra
option. If *data* is an array, and *index* is a scalar, then *index* is interpreted as
a sampling interval, and the signal basis will be constructed as uniformly sampled
starting from index 0.
